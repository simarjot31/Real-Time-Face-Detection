# Real-Time-Face-Detection
This repository demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV. The system captures live video from the webcam, detects faces in each frame using a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier, and displays the bounding boxes around detected faces, along with the total number of faces detected in real-time.
